# PulmoVision: Chest X-Ray AI Classifier

PulmoVision is a deep learning system for automated classification of chest X-ray images. The system can detect and differentiate between COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions using a Vision Transformer (ViT) neural network architecture.
 
## Features

- Classification of chest X-rays into four categories: COVID-19, Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia
- Web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction with the model
- API endpoint built with FastAPI for integration into other applications
- Docker support for simplified deployment
- Detailed visualization of classification results with confidence scores

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Access to the trained model file (VitFinal30_model.pth)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mozaloom/pulmo-vision.git
   cd PulmoVision
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Streamlit Application

The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing chest X-ray images:

```
cd streamlitapp
streamlit run app.py
```

Then access the application at http://localhost:8501

### FastAPI Service

The FastAPI service provides a REST API for programmatic access to the model:

```
cd webapp
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Docker Deployment

Build and run the Docker container:

```
docker build -t pulmovision .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 pulmovision
```

## Model Information

- Architecture: Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16)
